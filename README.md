# Leetcode_solutions

This repository is a compilation of all the LeetCode problems I have solved. It serves as a personal archive to track my progress, document my implementations in C++, and refine my understanding of various data structures and algorithms.

## Repository Structure

Solutions are organized by topic/pattern:

- Arrays and Hashing
- Two Pointers
- Sliding Window
- Stack
- Binary Search
- Linked List
- Trees
- Tries
- Priority Queue
- Backtracking
- Graphs
- Advanced Graphs
- 1-D DP
- 2-D DP
- Greedy
- Intervals
- Math and Geometry
- Bit Manipulation
- Design

## PDF Generator

This repository includes a Python script (`generate_leetcode_pdf.py`) that compiles all solutions into a single, professionally formatted PDF document.

### Features

- **Table of Contents** with clickable links to each problem
- **Syntax highlighting** for C++ code
- **Organized by category** following the NeetCode roadmap
- **One solution per page** for easy reading

### Usage

1. Install the required dependency:
   ```bash
   pip install reportlab
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python generate_leetcode_pdf.py
   ```

3. The PDF will be generated as `LeetCode_Solutions.pdf` in the repository root.
